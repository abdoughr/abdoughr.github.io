           <p>The idea of Jumpa popped up when we were running a dating website during the end of 2013. It appeared to us than thousands of great products are created for western users and an entire community was left behind. Muslims have different needs, different beliefs and following different principles. We decided to shut down the dating website and work part-time on a relationship mobile app for muslims.</p>
    
    <p>We brainstomed about the concept, went into a long process of a customer development to validate the early prototypes and the final version with potential users from our target audience. It was about understanding their needs and painful experiences then how we can help them. The process was made in sprints with a lot of refinements. It took time because we worked on it part-time but we are now finalizing the app which will be released sson.</p>

         <h1>Agapesis: Helping to change the charities landscape.</h1>
         
       <img src="http://localhost/portfolio/mywebsite/projects/pics/agapesis_screen.png" width="800" height="auto"></img>

           <p>I was thinking about the non-profit area for a long time. I finally decided to list small charities in Malaysia. I have been interrupted a lot of times by beggars during my Mamak dinners in KL. I asked my local friends about them who didn't trust the organisations sending these people. The main idea behind is to check manually the first charities, be sure that they using correctly their funds,  list them on the website and allow users to donate in a quick way. For now only charities helping the flood 2015 victims are displayed. It will evolve soon with more features.</p>
