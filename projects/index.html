         <h1>Jumpa: serious relationship for muslims.</h1>

           <p>The idea of Jumpa came up during December 2014 when we were running our first project: a social network in Malaysia where women shop men in a humorous way. At this time, our target audience was the urban chinese female. But it appeared to us than thousands of great products are created for western users and an entire community was left behind. Muslims have different needs, different beliefs and follow different principles. We decided to shut down the dating website and work part-time on a relationship mobile app for muslims.</p>

    <p>We brainstomed about the concept, went throught a long customer development proces in order to understand needs, validate the early concept and show low-fidelity prototypes. Once this has been done, we crafted some hi-fidelity prototypes with improvements/changes in each sprint and received for them positive feedback. At this poit  only we started developing the app for Android. It took us time because we worked on it part-time but we are now finalizing the app which will be released soon.</p>

         <h1>Agapesis: Helping to change the charities landscape.</h1>
    
    <p>I noticed that a few startups and tech projects are focusing on the non-profit area. I mean trying really to bring another point of view. Infact, this is the field that should be supported more than any other.</p>
         
       <img src="http://abdoughr.github.io/projects/pics/agapesis_screen.png" width="800" height="auto"></img>

           <p>I was thinking about the non-profit area since a long time. I finally decided to go for it during one week-end and listed down small charities in Malaysia. I have been interrupted a lot of times by beggars during dinners in KL. My local friends didn't trust the organisations behind these people. They believed that a lot of syndicates are around and they didn't like to donate because of this. The main idea behind the platform is to check manually the first charities, be sure that they using their funds with relevancy and allow users to reach them/donate in a quick way. For now, only charities helping the flood 2015 victims are displayed. It will evolve soon with more features.</p>
